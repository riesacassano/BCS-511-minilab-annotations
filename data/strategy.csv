377777,100%,"I was trying to listen carefully and pay attention to any ""climate"" change:)"
377777,75%,"I was still trying to listen carefully to the music (some kind of mix of classical and ""saloon"" music). I pay attention to the chang of ""climate""."
377777,50%,"I was still just trying to listen carefully I think. I pay attention to the drastic change in the ""climate"" of the music pieces."
377777,25%,"I was just trying to listen carefully. I pay attention to the drastic change of ""climate"" ot the music piece."
377770,100%,Nothing more than before :). Last melody I heard was more calm without many significant changes - almost all fit with each other.
377770,75%,The last pieces here were more mixed and shorteer so I had difficulties to decide whether there is meaningful changes or that mixed piece was a new piece. I used the same strategies as before (closed eyes and remember a song)
377770,50%,"I repeated previous strategies, but with small change because on piece nr 4 I felt that I clicked too fast during 1st listening  - I thought that there appeared meaningful change, however it was not, so later I tried to wait a bit longer, especially on 1st listening before making decision. I tried to remember more diffiult parts to click faster on second attempt."
377770,25%,"Second part seemed to be a bit more difficult than before, especially last melody with 2 pauses with it. I tried the same strategy as before - to feel the music and predict the next tones, but also during 2nd listening I closed my eyes."
377747,100%,I tried to imagine when one melody is complete
377747,75%,Sometimes I tried to imagine and finish or continue a melody in my mind
377747,50%,I used same strategy with closed eyes
377747,25%,Sometimes I tried to close eyes and imagine a melody.
377708,100%,Tried to pay attention to changes in instrumental
377708,75%,i felt like these sounds were more chaotic so i just followed my intuition
377708,50%,"Mostly focused on the tone, the way instrumental changed??"
377708,25%,"sometimes i felt like the mood of the music changed, also tried to pay attention to the change in tones"
377703,100%,"i tried to memorize the key parts of every piece, and recognize when they were being mixed, hence the change in the song."
377703,75%,"i tried to recognize the changes un tune, accordingly to the previous pieces and see if they changed somewhere between them"
377703,50%,"being aware of the stops in every piece of music, and the changes between them"
377703,25%,i listened to any significant change in the tempo or the chords used.
377701,100%,Using the vibration of the sound in my ears

377701,50%,Attention to the sound and the vibration
377701,25%,I use my feelings to listen if there was any change
377696,100%,For the first piece I used chords as I noticed there was a change when there was no chord. The second piece I used the pauses in the music and for the third I listened for a change in tone as it didn't sound that much different.
377696,75%,I listened for chords being played as I felt every time the music changed after a chord
377696,50%,I had to listen for a change in notes since were very few chords and the pauses were certainly an aid as well
377696,25%,I listened for a change in the lower notes as I assume it means the higher notes will change as well
377694,100%,theme change rhythm change
377694,75%,"looked for change in the melody, rhythm change"
377694,50%,identifying theme and base hand patterns
377694,25%,space on theme change or when the base hand changed its pattern
377692,100%,i listened carefully for pauses which immediately told me that there will be a change in music. i also listened carefully to the music playing without any distraction throughout
377692,75%,i listened for pauses which were indicative of a change in music
377692,50%,i listened hard and attentively
377692,25%,i listened for pauses and i knew that there will be a change in the music ( tune) playing after that pause

377678,100%,"At the end I tried to hear change, and then think for a second and mark that I heard change not immediately, but after a little bit of thought"
377678,75%,"I think I got better at listening to piano music and paying attention to more and more details. Still trying to spot tempo changes, pitch changes and accents but now I think I'm better at guessing which ones are actually meaningful"
377678,50%,"I'm sometimes second-guessing myself if something was meaningful change or just minor change, but the more I listen, the more I'm paying attention to smaller details + I'm trying to spot all things i mentioned earlier."
377678,25%,"I was trying to spot tempo changes, breaks in between of parts and accents at end of parts to hear if a part is ending or not "
377672,100%,Tried to look for unfamilarity
377672,75%,tried to look for parts that sound not familiar or weird

377664,75%,i mimic the sound of the music with my hands
377664,50%,this time i only closed my eyes to stay on focus
377664,25%,"i tried to make sequences, once the sound wouldn't fit in the sequence i'd create a new one and press the space bar"
377663,100%,I was looking for pauses and notes followed up by duilding up melody and other previously described methods
377663,75%,I was looking for moments building up tension and changing melody afterwards and previous methods
377663,50%,I was repeating previous methods
377663,25%,I was looking for a moment where the music had certain note higher or lower in between repeating sequences
377660,50%,I focused on the melody and speed
377660,25%,"I focused on the speed, melody and tone."
377650,100%,"The dynamic of the last pieces was, again, more conventional and not as dissonant, the changes were more palpable and noticeable"
377650,75%,"The last sequence was hard, the changes kepy happening and it's hard to keep track. The first two were easier in the sense that were more conventional and the changes were occasional."
377650,50%,"Again, the mood. Some changed in tone, tempo and cadence quite frequently, others not so much. The alternation between sustained notes and staccato are quite visible too"
377650,25%,"Hit the space bar whenever a change in mood would appear, this time it wasn't so much the tempo that mattered but the quick changes in tone and mood"
377648,100%,"I used the same strategy as before. Listening if the rhythm, melody or feeling of the songs changed"
377648,75%,"The same as before. Listening if the rhythm, melody or feeling of the song changes"
377648,50%,"Listening if the rhythm, melody or feeling of the song changes"
377648,25%,"Now I tried to see, not only changes in rhythm and melody, but also if the feelings transmitted in the song changes"

393320,50%,"the change in dynamics on both hands, the motifs and meaningful breaks"
393320,25%,"I pay attention to the use of both hands, so when there's a change on the rythm of the left hand i usually press the space bar, and when there's any stacatto. again when the otif changes and there'"
393277,100%,same as before
393277,75%,same as the last time + measuring the tempo change

393267,25%,"trying to imagine myself playing the piece, and listening closely to any rhytmic change and tone different sequences"
393263,100%,"I used the same strategy, but I pressed the space bar also when the melody changed more severely. I also used the first time to practice"
393263,75%,I didnÂ´t change my strategie
393263,50%,I pressed the space bar when I thought the tone and the rhythm changed together
393263,25%,"In some pieces was the big change in the rhythim and in other the tone, overall it was more intuition than other thing"
393251,100%,The 1st time I listen more relaxed and on the 2nd I focus more to find the changes
393251,75%,The first listening is like a preparatio
393251,50%,I just follow my instinct for the last few pieces because it felt diff
393251,25%,I close my eyes and try to focus on the song until I hear something worth of attention
393232,100%,i waited for major changes like parts not in the style of play or insignificant diferations 
393232,75%,the first i pressed in major changes but the third i closed my eyes and tryed to feel consistency
393232,50%,i only press when in my opinion the change had the duration to be considered significant and be meaningful. otherwise i 
393232,25%,did not press space much only in major changes in my opinion spe

393275,25%,"I pressed the spacebar when the mood of the music changed - when it was happy, sad or anxious also when the tempo changed. Often when the was a pause because it indicated the chang"
393254,100%,"the last one where the most difficult i think, but i was just listening to the mayor and minor tones and the pauses in the music"
393254,75%,listening to the pauses and silences in each piece
393254,50%,"in this time there wasnt so many silences, it was more the tone and intention of the pieces"

393253,25%,tried to keep my ears open for sudden breaks
393252,100%,I relied on my intuition.
393252,75%,I'm mostly using my intuition now.
393252,50%,"I'm generally just trying to relax and listen to the music instead of overthinking it anI press space whenever the music starts feeling ""off""."
393252,25%,It was difficult to determine at first what the change is but now I'm pressing space whe I feel like a new piece is being played (in the same recording).
393247,100%,"The dynamic changes now were more smooth, not as extreme as before, but despite that I could predict more or less accurately when a change that I would consider meaningful would come. I went mostly by "
393247,75%,I've started to go a little bit by instinct. Just stopped thinking too much about it and press the space bar whenever it felt meaningful
393247,50%,"The changes in the pieces dynamics have become so frequent, so I try to choose the more extreme ones. Also, I'm looking for other changes like when the second hand fully comes in."
393247,25%,"I tried to listen for changes in tonality, volume and tempo, also for dissonances. I now know that there are no background frequencies"
393249,100%,"It became a bit tiring, but the strategy continued."
393249,75%,I tried to hear the different beats
393249,50%,
393249,25%,I tried to listen to key changes
393245,100%,"I clicked the spacebar when I felt the music had changed it's vibe, like if it seemed like it changed to a different song by the tones and notes played."
393245,75%,I tapped the spacebar when I felt that the music had changed. I guided this by the notes and tones played and if they were different from the original bit.
393245,50%,"I tried to press the spacebar when I felt that the music had changed to another one, with the change of tones, notes and rythm that seemed different from the original piece."
393245,25%,"These seemed a lot harder but I clicked the space bar when I noticed that the overall vibe of the song changed a bit. For example, when the notes used did not align a lot with the first seconds of the song or the rest of the song."
393246,100%,mostly listening for difference in key but also listening fortempo changes. also counting the beat

393244,100%,"the strategies used didnt vary, i tried to spot low to high pitches and vice versa, but it was very dificult"
393244,75%,"this one was harder than the one before, but the strategy used was the same"
393244,50%,the same strategy as before. however this time it was a bit easier
393244,25%,"the songs tend to be very fluid, so its hard to notice any unusual change, but i try to find a high to low pitch transition"
393242,100%,"i think someone was ""talking"" and each tone was a different feeleng of the ""speaker"""
393242,75%,"i prefer to use the ""like talking"" strategy, so the music ""speaks"" and change the subject once in a while"
393242,50%,"Now i think it like different colors, but i noticed almost each tone is a different colors, the last one was a rainbown"
393242,25%,"I was thinking like someone was talking to me about something, then the rythm change and feel like starts talking about something else"
393241,100%,In this task the strategy I used was listening carefully to the melodies and try to determine the rhythm and tone until there was a variation 
393241,75%,"I listened to the tones and tried to figure when they were changing drastically, as the song progressed it was easier to find the differences."
393241,50%,I tried listening to the patterns in the sequences of music and try to differ when the music changed in tones
393241,25%,"I tried to hear closely on the changes in the patterns of the music, but I found it a bit difficult as the songs were extremely similar"

393236,100%,"I tried to focus more on the second attempt, because it's ea"
393236,75%,"Some of the music clips are so complicated. Now I try to just find the most meaningful change in rhythm, key and melody."
393236,50%,"It's harder to find a meaningful change, but still I try to focus on change of key, melody and speed"
393236,25%,I try to pinpoint the most important changes in keys and melody
393233,100%,At the last pecies i tried to observe not only the rythmic but also the melodic part of the songs so when i thought that the tone was changing i was pressing the button
393233,75%,At the last song i tried to press the button every time the rythic part of the chords changed
393233,50%,The same as before
393233,25%,I was pressing the button when the chords or the arp of the chords were changing
