377777,100%,"I was trying to listen carefully and pay attention to any ""climate"" change:)"
377777,75%,"I was still trying to listen carefully to the music (some kind of mix of classical and ""saloon"" music). I pay attention to the chang of ""climate""."
377777,50%,"I was still just trying to listen carefully I think. I pay attention to the drastic change in the ""climate"" of the music pieces."
377777,25%,"I was just trying to listen carefully. I pay attention to the drastic change of ""climate"" ot the music piece."
377777,practice_strategy,I was just tying to listen carefully to the piece I was hearing.
377770,100%,Nothing more than before :). Last melody I heard was more calm without many significant changes - almost all fit with each other.
377770,75%,The last pieces here were more mixed and shorteer so I had difficulties to decide whether there is meaningful changes or that mixed piece was a new piece. I used the same strategies as before (closed eyes and remember a song)
377770,50%,"I repeated previous strategies, but with small change because on piece nr 4 I felt that I clicked too fast during 1st listening  - I thought that there appeared meaningful change, however it was not, so later I tried to wait a bit longer, especially on 1st listening before making decision. I tried to remember more diffiult parts to click faster on second attempt."
377770,25%,"Second part seemed to be a bit more difficult than before, especially last melody with 2 pauses with it. I tried the same strategy as before - to feel the music and predict the next tones, but also during 2nd listening I closed my eyes."
377770,practice_strategy,"I was not sure to click space once or every time I notice meaningful change, so I clicked space few times. I tried to feel the rhythm, I mean just a melody whose successive tones fit together - if suddenly there was a change that I would normally classify as a fake, it was a sign for me that I was dealing with a significant (meaningful) change."
377747,100%,I tried to imagine when one melody is complete
377747,75%,Sometimes I tried to imagine and finish or continue a melody in my mind
377747,50%,I used same strategy with closed eyes
377747,25%,Sometimes I tried to close eyes and imagine a melody.
377747,practice_strategy,"I have pressed a spacebar, when changed melody, rhythm, volume  of sound"
377735,practice_strategy,"Mostly I was trying to decide whether key of melody changed, but I probably got too picky because of those notes labeled as ""b"" and ""#"" in music sheets."
377708,100%,Tried to pay attention to changes in instrumental
377708,75%,i felt like these sounds were more chaotic so i just followed my intuition
377708,50%,"Mostly focused on the tone, the way instrumental changed??"
377708,25%,"sometimes i felt like the mood of the music changed, also tried to pay attention to the change in tones"
377708,practice_strategy,i pressed space whenever the sequence of sounds changed
377703,100%,"i tried to memorize the key parts of every piece, and recognize when they were being mixed, hence the change in the song."
377703,75%,"i tried to recognize the changes un tune, accordingly to the previous pieces and see if they changed somewhere between them"
377703,50%,"being aware of the stops in every piece of music, and the changes between them"
377703,25%,i listened to any significant change in the tempo or the chords used.
377703,practice_strategy,"I had to pay attention to the changes in the music, relying on every fourth compass"
377701,100%,Using the vibration of the sound in my ears
377701,75%,"I feel the music, also i feel the changes"
377701,50%,Attention to the sound and the vibration
377701,25%,I use my feelings to listen if there was any change
377701,practice_strategy,The vibration of the sound
377696,100%,For the first piece I used chords as I noticed there was a change when there was no chord. The second piece I used the pauses in the music and for the third I listened for a change in tone as it didn't sound that much different.
377696,75%,I listened for chords being played as I felt every time the music changed after a chord
377696,50%,I had to listen for a change in notes since were very few chords and the pauses were certainly an aid as well
377696,25%,I listened for a change in the lower notes as I assume it means the higher notes will change as well
377696,practice_strategy,I listened for the pattern of the song and looked for a change in key
377694,100%,theme change rhythm change
377694,75%,"looked for change in the melody, rhythm change"
377694,50%,identifying theme and base hand patterns
377694,25%,space on theme change or when the base hand changed its pattern
377694,practice_strategy,Pressed space when the theme of the music changed
377692,100%,i listened carefully for pauses which immediately told me that there will be a change in music. i also listened carefully to the music playing without any distraction throughout
377692,75%,i listened for pauses which were indicative of a change in music
377692,50%,i listened hard and attentively
377692,25%,i listened for pauses and i knew that there will be a change in the music ( tune) playing after that pause
377692,practice_strategy,i listened carefully to the sounds. i was also attentive and remained quiet and still so as to ensure optimal hearing ability.
377685,100%,i guessed
377685,75%,guessed
377685,50%,listened for tonal changes and sections that were drastically different from the main piece
377685,25%,listened carefully and guessed
377685,practice_strategy,Closed my eyes and listened very carefully
377678,100%,"At the end I tried to hear change, and then think for a second and mark that I heard change not immediately, but after a little bit of thought"
377678,75%,"I think I got better at listening to piano music and paying attention to more and more details. Still trying to spot tempo changes, pitch changes and accents but now I think I'm better at guessing which ones are actually meaningful"
377678,50%,"I'm sometimes second-guessing myself if something was meaningful change or just minor change, but the more I listen, the more I'm paying attention to smaller details + I'm trying to spot all things i mentioned earlier."
377678,25%,"I was trying to spot tempo changes, breaks in between of parts and accents at end of parts to hear if a part is ending or not "
377678,practice_strategy,I was trying to spot either tempo changes or hear when notes are becoming different pitch
377672,100%,Tried to look for unfamilarity
377672,75%,tried to look for parts that sound not familiar or weird
377672,50%,"I try to remember the main marts of the music, but honestly its getting hard, as all of them starts to sound the same"
377672,25%,intuition
377672,practice_strategy,"Tried to memorize the song, also listened when it felt ""weird"""
377665,100%,when the sequence was interrupted to star a different one
377665,75%,when sound like it missed the tone
377665,50%,when the musics changed between them
377665,25%,when they seemd different songs
377665,practice_strategy,I pressed the space bar when it sounded like the another music was beginning
377664,100%,"this time i did not use a specific task, it was harder to stay on focus"
377664,75%,i mimic the sound of the music with my hands
377664,50%,this time i only closed my eyes to stay on focus
377664,25%,"i tried to make sequences, once the sound wouldn't fit in the sequence i'd create a new one and press the space bar"
377664,practice_strategy,i closed my eyes to be able to concentrate better
377663,100%,I was looking for pauses and notes followed up by duilding up melody and other previously described methods
377663,75%,I was looking for moments building up tension and changing melody afterwards and previous methods
377663,50%,I was repeating previous methods
377663,25%,I was looking for a moment where the music had certain note higher or lower in between repeating sequences
377663,practice_strategy,I was looking for changes in melody that had significant impact
377660,50%,I focused on the melody and speed
377660,25%,"I focused on the speed, melody and tone."
377660,practice_strategy,I focused on the difference in tone and melody.
377650,100%,"The dynamic of the last pieces was, again, more conventional and not as dissonant, the changes were more palpable and noticeable"
377650,75%,"The last sequence was hard, the changes kepy happening and it's hard to keep track. The first two were easier in the sense that were more conventional and the changes were occasional."
377650,50%,"Again, the mood. Some changed in tone, tempo and cadence quite frequently, others not so much. The alternation between sustained notes and staccato are quite visible too"
377650,25%,"Hit the space bar whenever a change in mood would appear, this time it wasn't so much the tempo that mattered but the quick changes in tone and mood"
377650,practice_strategy,Tried to quickly predict what the next progression could be. The changes were more significant in rhythm and tempo than in tone.
377648,100%,"I used the same strategy as before. Listening if the rhythm, melody or feeling of the songs changed"
377648,75%,"The same as before. Listening if the rhythm, melody or feeling of the song changes"
377648,50%,"Listening if the rhythm, melody or feeling of the song changes"
377648,25%,"Now I tried to see, not only changes in rhythm and melody, but also if the feelings transmitted in the song changes"
377648,practice_strategy,I tried to hear if the melody or rhythm changed in a notorious way
377647,100%,"identify major or minor tone, identify the different style"
377647,75%,different  music style
377647,50%,"Finals cadence, space between some piece"
377647,25%,"Identify major or minor tone, different styles or rythm variation"
377647,practice_strategy,identify a major or minor tone
